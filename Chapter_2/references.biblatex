	abstract = {Root hairs are tip-growing cells that emerge from the root epidermis and play a role in water and nutrient uptake. One of the key signaling steps for polar cell elongation is the formation of Rho-{GTP} by accelerating the intrinsic exchange activity of the Rho-of-plant ({ROP}) or the Rac {GTPase} protein; this step is activated through the interaction with the plant Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ({RopGEFs}). The molecular players involved in root hair growth in rice are largely unknown. Here, we performed the functional analysis of
              {OsRopGEF}3
              , which is highly expressed in the root hair tissues among the
              {OsRopGEF}
              family genes in rice. To reveal the role of {OsRopGEF}3, we analyzed the phenotype of loss-of-function mutants of
              {OsRopGEF}3
              , which were generated using the {CRISPR}-Cas9 system. The mutants had reduced root hair length and increased root hair width. In addition, we confirmed that reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) were highly reduced in the root hairs of the
              osropgef3
              mutant. The pairwise yeast two-hybrid experiments between {OsRopGEF}3 and {OsROP}/Rac proteins in rice revealed that the {OsRopGEF}3 protein interacts with {OsRac}3. This interaction and colocalization at the same subcellular organelles were again verified in tobacco leaf cells and rice root protoplasts via bimolecular functional complementation ({BiFC}) assay. Furthermore, among the three respiratory burst oxidase homolog ({OsRBOH}) genes that are highly expressed in rice root hair cells, we found that {OsRBOH}5 can interact with {OsRac}3. Our results demonstrate an interaction network model wherein {OsRopGEF}3 converts the {GDP} of {OsRac}3 into {GTP}, and {OsRac}3-{GTP} then interacts with the N-terminal of {OsRBOH}5 to produce {ROS}, thereby suggesting {OsRopGEF}3 as a key regulating factor in rice root hair growth.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
            Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows‚ÄìWheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is ‚àº10‚Äì20√ó faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.

              {AP}1
              transcription was regulated by vernalization in both apices and leaves, and the progressive increase of
              {AP}1
              transcription was consistent with the progressive effect of vernalization on flowering time. Vernalization was required for
              {AP}1
              transcription in apices and leaves in winter wheat but not in spring wheat.
              {AGLG}1
              transcripts were detected during spike differentiation but not in vernalized apices or leaves, suggesting that
              {AP}1
              acts upstream of
              {AGLG}1
              . No differences were detected between genotypes with different
              {VRN}1
              alleles in the
              {AP}1
              and

              coding regions, but three independent deletions were found in the promoter region of
              {AP}1
              . These results suggest that
              {AP}1
              is a better candidate for
              {VRN}1
              than

Although a large number of these have been documented, it is likely that many more remain unknown. To map these variable regions and make them more traceable in breeding programs, wheat accessions need to be genotyped or sequenced. The wheat genome is large and complex and consequently, sequencing efforts are often targeted through exome capture. In this study, we employed exome capture prior to sequencing 12 wheat varieties; 10 elite
              T. aestivum
              cultivars and two
              T. aestivum
              landrace accessions. Sequence coverage across chromosomes was greater toward distal regions of chromosome arms and lower in centromeric regions, reflecting the capture probe distribution which itself is determined by the known telomere to centromere gene gradient. Superimposed on this general pattern, numerous drops in sequence coverage were observed. Several of these corresponded with reported introgressions. Other drops in coverage could not be readily explained and may point to introgressions that have not, to date, been documented.},

Thus far, there have been few reports on the characterization of the Rboh gene family in Citrus. In this study, seven Rboh genes ({CsRbohA}{\textasciitilde}{CsRbohG}) were identified in the Citrus sinensis genome. The {CsRboh} proteins were predicted to localize to the cell membrane. Most {CsRbohs} contained four conserved domains, an {EF}-hand domain, and a transmembrane region. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the {CsRbohs} were divided into five groups, suggesting potential distinct functions and evolution. The expression profiles revealed that these seven {CsRboh} genes displayed tissue-specific expression patterns, and five {CsRboh} genes were responsive to cold stress. Fourteen putative cis-acting elements related to stress response, hormone response, and development regulation were present within the promoters of {CsRboh} genes. The in-silico {microRNA} target transcript analyses indicated that {CsRbohE} might be targeted by csi-{miR}164. Further functional and physiological analyses showed that the knockdown of {CsRbohD} in trifoliate orange impaired resistance to cold stress. As a whole, our results provide valuable information for further functional studies of the {CsRboh} genes in response to cold stress.},

            Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org) is unique in its flexible infrastructure for access to genomic data and annotation. It has been designed to efficiently deliver annotation at scale for all eukaryotic life, and it also provides deep comprehensive annotation for key species. Genomes representing a greater diversity of species are increasingly being sequenced. In response, we have focussed our recent efforts on expediting the annotation of new assemblies. Here, we report the release of the greatest annual number of newly annotated genomes in the history of Ensembl via our dedicated Ensembl Rapid Release platform (http://rapid.ensembl.org). We have also developed a new method to generate comparative analyses at scale for these assemblies and, for the first time, we have annotated non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Meanwhile, we continually improve, extend and update the annotation for our high-value reference vertebrate genomes and report the details here. We have a range of specific software tools for specific tasks, such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor ({VEP}) and the newly developed interface for the Variant Recoder. All Ensembl data, software and tools are freely available for download and are accessible programmatically.},

              Background
              
                Homoeologs are defined as homologous genes resulting from allopolyploidy. Bread wheat,
                Triticum aestivum
                , is an allohexaploid species with many homoeologs. Homoeolog expression bias, referring to the relative contribution of homoeologs to the transcriptome, is critical for determining the traits that influence wheat growth and development. Asymmetric transcription of homoeologs has been so far investigated in a tissue or organ-specific manner, which could be misleading due to a mixture of cell types.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Here, we perform single nuclei {RNA} sequencing and {ATAC} sequencing of wheat root to study the asymmetric gene transcription, reconstruct cell differentiation trajectories and cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks. We identify 22 cell types. We then reconstruct cell differentiation trajectories that suggest different origins between epidermis/cortex and endodermis, distinguishing bread wheat from
                Arabidopsis
                . We show that the ratio of asymmetrically transcribed triads varies greatly when analyzing at the single-cell level. Hub transcription factors determining cell type identity are also identified. In particular, we demonstrate that {TaSPL}14 participates in vasculature development by regulating the expression of
                {BAM}1
                . Combining single-cell transcription and chromatin accessibility data, we construct the pseudo-time regulatory network driving root hair differentiation. We find {MYB}3R4, {REF}6, {HDG}1, and {GATAs} as key regulators in this process.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings reveal the transcriptional landscape of root organization and asymmetric gene transcription at single-cell resolution in polyploid wheat.},

To understand the origin and regulation of this patterning mechanism, we have examined the embryonic expression of the {GLABRA}2 ({GL}2) gene, which encodes a cell-type-specific transcription factor. Using in situ {RNA} hybridization and a sensitive {GL}2::{GFP} reporter, we discovered that a position-dependent pattern of {GL}2 expression is established within protodermal cells at the heart stage and is maintained throughout the remainder of embryogenesis. In addition, we show that an exceptional {GL}2 expression character and epidermal cell pattern arises during development of the root-hypocotyl junction, which represents an anatomical transition zone. Furthermore, we find that two of the genes regulating seedling epidermal patterning, {TRANSPARENT} {TESTA} {GLABRA} ({TTG}) and {WEREWOLF} ({WER}), also control the embryonic {GL}2 pattern, whereas the {CAPRICE} ({CPC}) and {GL}2 genes are not required to establish this pattern. These results indicate that position-dependent patterning of epidermal cell types begins at an early stage of embryogenesis, before formation of the apical meristems and shortly after the cellular anatomy of the protoderm and outer ground tissue layer is established. Thus, epidermal cell specification in the Arabidopsis seedling relies on the embryonic establishment of a patterning mechanism that is perpetuated postembryonically.},

              Soil is essential for sustaining life on land. Plant roots play a crucial role in stabilising soil and minimising erosion, although these mechanisms are still not completely understood. Consequently, identifying and breeding for plant traits to enhance erosion resistance is challenging. Root hair mutants in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              were studied using three different quantitative methods to isolate their effect on root-soil cohesion. We present compelling evidence that micro-scale interactions of root hairs with surrounding soil increase soil cohesion and reduce erosion. Arabidopsis seedlings with root hairs were more difficult to detach from soil, compost and sterile gel media than those with hairless roots, and it was 10-times harder to erode soil from roots with than without hairs. We also developed a model that can consistently predict the impact root hairs make to soil erosion resistance. Our study thus provides new insight into the mechanisms by which roots maintain soil stability.},

Wheat plants of cultivar Chinese Spring were grown at various temperature regimes at several stages of reproductive development for different durations. The objectives of this research were to (i) identify the stage(s) most sensitive to {HT} stress during reproductive development, and (ii) determine threshold temperature and duration of {HT} stress that decrease floret fertility and individual grain weight. Two periods (first at 8‚Äì6 days before anthesis and second at 2‚Äì0 days before anthesis) during reproductive development were most sensitive to short episodes (2 or 5 days) of {HT} stress, causing maximum decreases in floret fertility. Short episodes (5 days) of mean daily temperatures {\textgreater}24¬∞C imposed at start of heading quadratically decreased floret fertility, with the values reaching close to 0\% around mean daily temperature of 35¬∞C; and floret fertility and individual grain weight decreased linearly with increasing duration (in the range from 2 to 30 days) of {HT} stress when imposed at start of heading or start of grain filling respectively. {HT} stress caused morphological abnormalities in pollen, stigma and style. The combination of lower floret fertility (leading to decreased grain numbers) and decreased individual grain weights can cause significant decreases in grain yield. Further research to search for genetic variability for these traits and use them in breeding programs to develop tolerant genotypes that can provide yield stability under current and future climates is warranted.},

              Successful crop production depends initially on the availability of high-quality seed. By 2050 global climate change will have influenced crop yields, but will these changes affect seed quality? The present review examines the effects of elevated carbon dioxide ({CO}
              2
              ) and temperature during seed production on three seed quality components: seed mass, germination and seed vigour.
            
            
              In response to elevated {CO}
              2
              , seed mass has been reported to both increase and decrease in C
              3
              plants, but not change in C
              4
              plants. Increases are greater in legumes than non-legumes, and there is considerable variation among species. Seed mass increases may result in a decrease of seed nitrogen (N) concentration in non-legumes. Increasing temperature may decrease seed mass because of an accelerated growth rate and reduced seed filling duration, but lower seed mass does not necessarily reduce seed germination or vigour.

              have been variable. The reported changes in seed C/N ratio can decrease seed protein content which may eventually lead to reduced viability. Conversely, increased ethylene production may stimulate germination in some species. High-temperature stress before developing seeds reach physiological maturity ({PM}) can reduce germination by inhibiting the ability of the plant to supply the assimilates necessary to synthesize the storage compounds required for germination.
            
            
              Nothing is known concerning the effects of elevated {CO}
              2
              on seed vigour. However, seed vigour can be reduced by high-temperature stress both before and after {PM}. High temperatures induce or increase the physiological deterioration of seeds. Limited evidence suggests that only short periods of high-temperature stress at critical seed development stages are required to reduce seed vigour, but further research is required.
            
            The predicted environmental changes will lead to losses of seed quality, particularly for seed vigour and possibly germination. The seed industry will need to consider management changes to minimize the risk of this occurring.},

However, single gl3mutations only affect the trichome pathway with a modest trichome number reduction. A novel unlinked {bHLH}-encoding locus is described here, {ENHANCER} {OF} {GLABRA}3 ({EGL}3). When mutated, egl3gives totally glabrous plants only in the gl3 mutant background. The double {bHLH} mutant, gl3 egl3, has a pleiotropic phenotype like ttg1 having defective anthocyanin production, seed coat mucilage production, and position-dependent root hair spacing. Furthermore, the triple {bHLH} mutant, gl3 egl3 tt8, phenocopies the ttg1 mutation. Yeast two-hybrid and plant overexpression studies show that {EGL}3, like {GL}3,interacts with {TTG}1, the myb proteins {GL}1, {PAP}1 and 2, {CPC} and {TRY}, and it will form heterodimers with {GL}3. These results suggest a combinatorial model for {TTG}1-dependent pathway regulation by this trio of partially functionally redundant {bHLH} proteins.},

	abstract = {Previously characterized Arabidopsis gl3 mutants have trichomes that are smaller, less branched and undergo fewer rounds of endoreplication than wild-type trichomes. A new gl3 mutant, called gl3-sst,has oddly shaped trichomes that over expand during early development, undergo more endoreduplication and that have a striking nuclear morphology. The mutant nuclei consist of many interconnected lobes; however, only a single set of polytene-like chromosomes reside in the mutant nuclei. The predicted gl3-sst polypeptide has a Leu to Phe substitution (codon 78) within a region responsible for protein-protein interaction. Yeast interaction assays comparing {GL}3 with gl3-sst proteins show that the mutant protein interaction with {GL}1 and {TTG}1 is decreased by 75\% and 50\%, respectively, but there is no difference in its interaction with {TRY}. Furthermore, {TRY} has the ability to prevent the {GL}1 {GL}3 interaction and the {GL}1 gl3-sst interaction is even more sensitive to {TRY}. Analysis of plants expressing functional {GFP}-tagged versions of {GL}1, {GL}3 and {TRY} show that the proteins are localized in trichome nuclei. These results have been used to model trichome initiation in terms of protein interactions and threshold levels of activator complex.},

Comparative gene analysis of wheat subgenomes and extant diploid and tetraploid wheat relatives showed that high sequence similarity and structural conservation are retained, with limited gene loss, after polyploidization. However, across the genomes there was evidence of dynamic gene gain, loss, and duplication since the divergence of the wheat lineages. A high degree of transcriptional autonomy and no global dominance was found for the subgenomes. These insights into the genome biology of a polyploid crop provide a springboard for faster gene isolation, rapid genetic marker development, and precise breeding to meet the needs of increasing food demand worldwide.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Motivation
              In {RNA}-seq differential expression analysis, investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in expression level across conditions, despite technical and biological variability in the observations. A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change ({LFC}).
            
            
              Results
              When the read counts are low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the {LFCs} has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated {LFCs}. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model, apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with little information for statistical inference.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              The apeglm package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/apeglm, and the methods can be called from within the {DESeq}2 software.

	abstract = {The genetics, molecular biology and nutrient uptake of plant root hair mutants have been studied in detail, but their physiological responses to soil drying have not. Thus, the root hairless brb (bald root barley) barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutant and its wild type ({WT}) were grown in drying soil. Well-watered, pre-tillering plants showed no genotypic differences in daily transpiration and leaf elongation rate, and the ratio of day to night leaf elongation (D/N, a sensitive indicator of water stress). After withholding water for 25 days, root hydraulic conductivity and xylem {ABA} concentration were similar between genotypes, but {WT} plants had more tillers and D/N was more than halved in brb. To avoid possible developmental and nutritional differences confounding responses to water deficit, pre-tillering plants were allowed to dry soils of high and low phosphorus (P) status. Although leaf area, leaf water potential and shoot fresh weight ({FW}) were similar in the two genotypes, root {FW} of brb was greater by 44 and 18\% in a high and low P soil respectively. This adaptive response allowed brb to maintain similar shoot growth and transpiration as {WT} plants, despite decreased effective root surface area in the absence of root hairs.},

              Background and Aims
              The utility of root hairs for nitrogen (N) acquisition is poorly understood.
            
            
              Methods
              We explored the utility of root hairs for N acquisition in the functional‚Äìstructural model {SimRoot} and with maize genotypes with variable root hair length ({RHL}) in greenhouse and field environments.
            
            
              Key Results
              Simulation results indicate that long, dense root hairs can improve N acquisition under varying N availability. In the greenhouse, ammonium availability had no effect on {RHL} and low nitrate availability increased {RHL}, while in the field low N reduced {RHL}. Longer {RHL} was associated with 216 \% increase in biomass and 237 \% increase in plant N content under low-N conditions in the greenhouse and a 250 \% increase in biomass and 200 \% increase in plant N content in the field compared with short-{RHL} phenotypes. In a low-N field environment, genotypes with long {RHL} had 267 \% greater yield than those with short {RHL}. We speculate that long root hairs improve N capture by increased root surface area and expanded soil exploration beyond the N depletion zone surrounding the root surface.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We conclude that root hairs play an important role in N acquisition. We suggest that root hairs merit consideration as a breeding target for improved N acquisition in maize and other crops.},

To date, no one has developed a unified methodology for aligning converted sequences and consolidating alignment of these technologies in one package. In this paper, we describe hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts‚Äì3 nucleotides ({HISAT}-3N), which can rapidly and accurately align sequences consisting of any nucleotide conversion by leveraging the powerful hierarchical index and repeat index algorithms originally developed for the {HISAT} software. Tests on real and simulated data sets show that {HISAT}-3N is faster than other modern systems, with greater alignment accuracy, higher scalability, and smaller memory requirements. {HISAT}-3N therefore becomes an ideal aligner when used with converted sequence technologies.},

            The Gene Ontology Consortium ({GOC}) provides the most comprehensive resource currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products. Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two years. The new {GO}-{CAM} annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 {GO}-{CAMs}. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine {GO} and report a 10\% increase in the number of {GO} annotations, a 25\% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer findings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5\% of experimental {GO} annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of {GO} data with a consistent format and file structure for both the ontology and annotations.},

            The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis ({MEGA}) software has matured to contain a large collection of methods and tools of computational molecular evolution. Here, we describe new additions that make {MEGA} a more comprehensive tool for building timetrees of species, pathogens, and gene families using rapid relaxed-clock methods. Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery. Natively compiled graphical user interface and command-line versions of {MEGA}11 are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and {macOS} from www.megasoftware.net.},

              Bulked segregant analysis implemented in {MutMap} and {QTL}-seq is a powerful and efficient method to identify loci contributing to important phenotypic traits. However, the previous pipelines were not user-friendly to install and run. Here, we describe new pipelines for {MutMap} and {QTL}-seq. These updated pipelines are approximately 5‚Äì8 times faster than the previous pipeline, are easier for novice users to use, and can be easily installed through bioconda with all dependencies.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Bulk segregant analysis is a technique for identifying the genetic loci that underlie phenotypic trait differences. The basic approach is to compare two pools of individuals from the opposing tails of the phenotypic distribution, sampled from an interbred population. Each pool is sequenced and scanned for alleles that show divergent frequencies between the pools, indicating potential association with the observed trait differences. Bulk segregant analysis has already been successfully applied to the mapping of various quantitative trait loci in organisms ranging from yeast to maize. However, these studies have typically suffered from rather low mapping resolution, and we still lack a detailed understanding of how this resolution is affected by experimental parameters. Here, we use coalescence theory to calculate the expected genomic resolution of bulk segregant analysis for a simple monogenic trait. We first show that in an idealized interbreeding population of infinite size, the expected length of the mapped region is inversely proportional to the recombination rate, the number of generations of interbreeding, and the number of genomes sampled, as intuitively expected. In a finite population, coalescence events in the genealogy of the sample reduce the number of potentially informative recombination events during interbreeding, thereby increasing the length of the mapped region. This is incorporated into our model by an effective population size parameter that specifies the pairwise coalescence rate of the interbreeding population. The mapping resolution predicted by our calculations closely matches numerical simulations and is surprisingly robust to moderate levels of contamination of the segregant pools with alternative alleles. Furthermore, we show that the approach can easily be extended to modifications of the crossing scheme. Our framework will allow researchers to predict the expected power of their mapping experiments, and to evaluate how their experimental design could be tuned to optimize mapping resolution.},

              Root Hairs ({RHs}) growth is influenced by endogenous and by external environmental signals that coordinately regulate its final cell size. We have recently determined that {RH} growth was unexpectedly boosted when
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              seedlings are cultivated at low temperatures. It was proposed that {RH} growth plasticity in response to low temperature was linked to a reduced nutrient availability in the media. Here, we explore the molecular basis of this {RH} growth response by using a Genome Wide Association Study ({GWAS}) approach using
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              natural accessions. We identify the poorly characterized {PEROXIDASE} 62 ({PRX}62) and a related protein {PRX}69 as key proteins under moderate low temperature stress. Strikingly, a cell wall protein extensin ({EXT}) reporter reveals the effect of peroxidase activity on {EXT} cell wall association at 10‚Äâ¬∞C in the {RH} apical zone. Collectively, our results indicate that {PRX}62, and to a lesser extent {PRX}69, are key apoplastic {PRXs} that modulate {ROS}-homeostasis and cell wall {EXT}-insolubilization linked to {RH} elongation at low temperature.},

            {CASPARIAN} {STRIP} {MEMBRANE} {DOMAIN} {PROTEINS} ({CASPs}) are four-membrane-span proteins that mediate the deposition of Casparian strips in the endodermis by recruiting the lignin polymerization machinery. {CASPs} show high stability in their membrane domain, which presents all the hallmarks of a membrane scaffold. Here, we characterized the large family of {CASP}-like ({CASPL}) proteins. {CASPLs} were found in all major divisions of land plants as well as in green algae; homologs outside of the plant kingdom were identified as members of the {MARVEL} protein family. When ectopically expressed in the endodermis, most {CASPLs} were able to integrate the {CASP} membrane domain, which suggests that {CASPLs} share with {CASPs} the propensity to form transmembrane scaffolds. Extracellular loops are not necessary for generating the scaffold, since {CASP}1 was still able to localize correctly when either one of the extracellular loops was deleted. The {CASP} first extracellular loop was found conserved in euphyllophytes but absent in plants lacking Casparian strips, an observation that may contribute to the study of Casparian strip and root evolution. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), {CASPL} showed specific expression in a variety of cell types, such as trichomes, abscission zone cells, peripheral root cap cells, and xylem pole pericycle cells.},

              In Arabidopsis, a {MYB}-{bHLH}-{WD}40 ({MBW}) transcriptional activator complex activates the homeodomain protein gene
              {GLABRA}2
              (
              {GL}2
              ), leading to the promotion of trichome formation and inhibition of root hair formation. The same {MBW} complex also activates single-repeat R3 {MYB} genes. R3 {MYBs} in turn, play a negative feedback role by competing with R2R3 {MYB} proteins for binding {bHLH} proteins, thus blocking the formation of the {MBW} complex. By {BLASTing} the rice (
              Oryza sativa
              ) protein database using the entire amino acid sequence of Arabidopsis R3 {MYB} transcription factor {TRICHOMELESS}1 ({TCL}1), we found that there are two genes in rice genome encoding R3 {MYB} transcription factors, namely
              Oryza sativa {TRICHOMELESS}1
              (
              {OsTCL}1
              ) and
              {OsTCL}2
              . Expressing
              {OsTCL}1
              in Arabidopsis inhibited trichome formation and promoted root hair formation and {OsTCL}1 interacted with {GL}3 when tested in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Consistent with these observations, expression levels of

              , R2R3 {MYB} transcription factor gene
              {GLABRA}1
              (
              {GL}1
              ) and several R3 {MYB} genes were greatly reduced, indicating that {OsTCL}1 is functional R3 {MYB}. However, trichome and root hair formation in transgenic rice plants overexpressing
              {OsTCL}1
              remained largely unchanged and elevated expression of
              {OsGL}2
              was observed in the transgenic rice plants, indicating that rice may use different mechanisms to regulate trichome formation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Root hairs are long tubular outgrowths that form on the surface of specialized epidermal cells. They are required for nutrient and water uptake and interact with the soil microflora. Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 ({OsCSLD}1) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack {OsCSLD}1 function develop abnormal root hairs. In these mutants, while hair development is initiated normally, the hairs elongate less than the wild-type hairs and they have kinks and swellings along their length. Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that {OsCSLD}1 function is required for hair elongation but not initiation. Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that {OsCSLD}1 is expressed in only root hair cells. Furthermore, {OsCSLD}1 is the only member of the four rice {CSLD} genes that shows root-specific expression. Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene {KOJAK}/{AtCSLD}3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that {OsCSLD}1 may be the functional ortholog of {KOJAK}/{AtCSLD}3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins. Thus, at least part of the mechanism of root hair morphogenesis in Arabidopsis is conserved in rice.},

              {ENHANCED} {GRAVITROPISM}1
              (
              {EGT}1
              ) that encodes a putative {AGO} component, whose loss-of-function enhances root gravitropism. Mutations in barley and wheat
              {EGT}1
              genes confer a striking root phenotype, where every root class adopts a steeper growth angle.
              {EGT}1
              encodes an F-box and Tubby domain-containing protein that is highly conserved across plant species. Haplotype analysis found that natural allelic variation at the barley
              {EGT}1
              locus impacts root angle. Gravitropic assays indicated that
              Hvegt1
              roots bend more rapidly than wild-type. Transcript profiling revealed
              Hvegt1
              roots deregulate reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) homeostasis and cell wall-loosening enzymes and cofactors. {ROS} imaging shows that

              is expressed in elongating cortical and stele tissues, which are distinct from known root gravitropic perception and response tissues in the columella and epidermis, respectively. We propose that {EGT}1 controls root angle by regulating cell wall stiffness in elongating root cortical tissue, counteracting the gravitropic machinery‚Äôs known ability to bend the root via its outermost tissues. We conclude that root angle is controlled by

            Virus-induced gene silencing ({VIGS}) is an important tool for the analysis of gene function in plants. In {VIGS}, viruses engineered to carry sequences derived from plant gene transcripts activate the host's sequence-specific {RNA} degradation system. This mechanism targets the {RNAs} of the viral genome for degradation, and as the virus contains transcribed plant sequence, homologous host {mRNAs} are also targeted for destruction. While routinely used in some dicots, no {VIGS} system was known for monocot plants until the recent report of silencing in barley (Hordeum vulgare) by barley stripe mosaic virus ({BSMV}). Here, we report development of protocols for use of {BSMV} to efficiently silence genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). The {VIGS} system was first optimized in studies silencing phytoene desaturase expression. Next, we used it to assay genes functioning in leaf rust resistance mediated by Lr21, which encodes a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat class resistance gene product. We demonstrated that infection with {BSMV} constructs carrying a 150-bp fragment of Lr21 caused conversion of incompatible interactions to compatible, whereas infection with a control construct or one that silences phytoene desaturase had no effect on resistance or susceptibility. Additionally, silencing the {RAR}1, {SGT}1, and {HSP}90 genes, known to be required in many but not all nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat resistance pathways in diverse plant species, resulted in conversion to compatibility, indicating that these genes are essential in Lr21-mediated resistance. These studies indicate that {BSMV}-{VIGS} is a powerful tool for dissecting the genetic pathways of disease resistance in hexaploid wheat.},

              Aims
              
                Selection for optimal root system architecture ({RSA}) is important to ensure genetic gains in the sustainable production of wheat (
                Triticum aestivum
                L.). Here we examine the hypothesis that past wheat breeding has led to changes in {RSA} and that future breeding efforts can focus directly on {RSA} to improve adaptation to target environments.
              
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted field trials using diverse wheat varieties, including modern and historic {UK} varieties and non-{UK} landraces, tested under contrasting tillage regimes (non-inversion tillage versus conventional ploughing) for two trial years or different seeding rates (standard versus high rate) for one trial year. We used field excavation, washing and measurement of root crowns (‚Äòshovelomics‚Äô) to characterise {RSA} traits, including: numbers of seminal, crown and nodal roots per plant, and crown root growth angle.
            
            
              Results
              We found differences among genotypes for all root traits. Modern varieties generally had fewer roots per plant than historic varieties. On average, there were fewer crown roots and root angles were wider under shallow non-inversion tillage compared with conventional ploughing. Crown root numbers per plant also tended to be smaller at a high seeding rate compared with the standard. There were significant genotype-by-year, genotype-by-tillage and genotype-by-seeding-rate interactions for many root traits.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Smaller root systems are likely to be a result of past selection that facilitated historical yield increases by reducing below-ground competition within the crop. The effects of crop management practices on {RSA} depend on genotype, suggesting that future breeding could select for improved {RSA} traits in resource-efficient farming systems.},

            We present a novel image analysis tool that allows the semiautomated quantification of complex root system architectures in a range of plant species grown and imaged in a variety of ways. The automatic component of {RootNav} takes a top-down approach, utilizing the powerful expectation maximization classification algorithm to examine regions of the input image, calculating the likelihood that given pixels correspond to roots. This information is used as the basis for an optimization approach to root detection and quantification, which effectively fits a root model to the image data. The resulting user experience is akin to defining routes on a motorist‚Äôs satellite navigation system: {RootNav} makes an initial optimized estimate of paths from the seed point to root apices, and the user is able to easily and intuitively refine the results using a visual approach. The proposed method is evaluated on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) images (and demonstrated on Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana], Brassica napus, and rice [Oryza sativa]), and results are compared with manual analysis. Four exemplar traits are calculated and show clear illustrative differences between some of the wheat accessions. {RootNav}, however, provides the structural information needed to support extraction of a wider variety of biologically relevant measures. A separate viewer tool is provided to recover a rich set of architectural traits from {RootNav}‚Äôs core representation.},

            Seedling establishment is the first stage of crop productivity, and root phenotypes at seed emergence are critical to a successful start of shoot growth as well as for water and nutrient uptake. In this study, we investigate seedling establishment in winter wheat utilizing a newly developed workflow based on magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). Using the eight parents of the {MAGIC} (multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross) population we analysed the 4D root architecture of 288 individual seedlings grown in natural soils with plant neighbors over 3 d of development. Time of root and shoot emergence, total length, angle, and depth of the axile roots varied significantly among these genotypes. The temporal data resolved rates of elongation of primary roots and first and second seminal root pairs. Genotypes with slowly elongating primary roots had rapidly elongating first and second seminal root pairs and vice versa, resulting in variation in root system architecture mediated not only by root angle but also by initiation and relative elongation of axile roots. We demonstrated that our novel {MRI} workflow with a unique planting design and automated measurements allowed medium throughput phenotyping of wheat roots in 4D and could give new insights into regulation of root system architecture.},

            The necrotrophic fungus Parastagonospora nodorum is an important pathogen of one of the world‚Äôs most economically important cereal crops, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). P. nodorum produces necrotrophic protein effectors that mediate host cell death, providing nutrients for continuation of the infection process. The recent discovery of pathogen effectors has revolutionized disease resistance breeding for necrotrophic diseases in crop species, allowing often complex genetic resistance mechanisms to be broken down into constituent parts. To date, three effectors have been identified in P. nodorum. Here we use the effector, {SnTox}1, to screen 642 progeny from an eight-parent multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (i.e., {MAGIC}) population, genotyped with a 90,000-feature single-nucleotide polymorphism array. The {MAGIC} founders showed a range of sensitivity to {SnTox}1, with transgressive segregation evident in the progeny. {SnTox}1 sensitivity showed high heritability, with quantitative trait locus analyses fine-mapping the Snn1 locus to the short arm of chromosome 1B. In addition, a previously undescribed {SnTox}1 sensitivity locus was identified on the long arm of chromosome 5A, termed here {QSnn}.niab-5A.1. The peak single-nucleotide polymorphism for the Snn1 locus was converted to the {KASP} genotyping platform, providing breeders and researchers a simple and cheap diagnostic marker for allelic state at Snn1.},

            Improvement in traits of agronomic importance is the top breeding priority of crop improvement programs. Majority of these agronomic traits show complex quantitative inheritance. Identification of quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) followed by fine mapping {QTLs} and cloning of candidate genes/{QTLs} is central to trait analysis. Advances in genomic technologies revolutionized our understanding of genetics of complex traits, and genomic regions associated with traits were employed in marker-assisted breeding or cloning of {QTLs}/genes. Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technologies have enabled genome-wide methodologies for the development of ultra-high-density genetic linkage maps in different crops, thus allowing placement of candidate loci within few kbs in genomes. In this review, we compare the marker systems used for fine mapping and {QTL} cloning in the pre- and post-{NGS} era. We then discuss how different {NGS} platforms in combination with advanced experimental designs have improved trait analysis and fine mapping. We opine that efficient genotyping/sequencing assays may circumvent the need for cumbersome procedures that were earlier used for fine mapping. A deeper understanding of the trait architectures of agricultural significance will be crucial to accelerate crop improvement.},

However, due to resolution issues and methodological limitations, the true causal variants and genes associated with traits remain difficult to identify. In this post-{GWAS} era, many biological and computational fine-mapping approaches now aim to solve these issues. Here, we review fine-mapping and gene prioritization approaches that, when combined, will improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of complex traits and diseases. Fine-mapping of genetic variants has become increasingly sophisticated: initially, variants were simply overlapped with functional elements, but now the impact of variants on regulatory activity and direct variant-gene 3D interactions can be identified. Moreover, gene manipulation by {CRISPR}/Cas9, the identification of expression quantitative trait loci and the use of co-expression networks have all increased our understanding of the genes and pathways affected by {GWAS} loci. However, despite this progress, limitations including the lack of cell-type- and disease-specific data and the ever-increasing complexity of polygenic models of traits pose serious challenges. Indeed, the combination of fine-mapping and gene prioritization by statistical, functional and population-based strategies will be necessary to truly understand how {GWAS} loci contribute to complex traits and diseases.},

            Roots are the main channel for water and nutrient uptake in plants. Optimization of root architecture provides a viable strategy to improve nutrient and water uptake efficiency and maintain crop productivity under water-limiting and nutrient-poor conditions. We know little, however, about the genetic control of root development in wheat, a crop supplying 20\% of global calorie and protein intake. To improve our understanding of the genetic control of seminal root development in wheat, we conducted a high-throughput screen for variation in seminal root number using an exome-sequenced mutant population derived from the hexaploid wheat cultivar Cadenza. The screen identified seven independent mutants with homozygous and stably altered seminal root number phenotypes. One mutant, Cadenza0900, displays a recessive extra seminal root number phenotype, while six mutants (Cadenza0062, Cadenza0369, Cadenza0393, Cadenza0465, Cadenza0818 and Cadenza1273) show lower seminal root number phenotypes most likely originating from defects in the formation and activation of seminal root primordia. Segregation analysis in F2 populations suggest that the phenotype of Cadenza0900 is controlled by multiple loci whereas the Cadenza0062 phenotype fits a 3:1 mutant:wild-type segregation ratio characteristic of dominant single gene action. This work highlights the potential to use the sequenced wheat mutant population as a forward genetic resource to uncover novel variation in agronomic traits, such as seminal root architecture.},

            Six cycles of recurrent selection for early shoot vigour in wheat resulted in significant increases in leaf width and shoot biomass. Here, in replicated controlled-environment studies, the effect of early shoot vigour on root biomass, rhizosheath size, root hair length, and cell size in the roots and leaves was examined across different cycles of selection. Increased shoot vigour was associated with greater root biomass, larger rhizosheath size, and longer root hairs. Our findings demonstrate that rhizosheath size was a reliable surrogate for root hair length in this germplasm. Examination of the root epidermis revealed that the ‚Äòcell body‚Äô of the trichoblasts (hair-forming cells) and the atrichoblasts (non-hair-forming cells) decreased in size as shoot vigour increased. Therefore, in higher vigour germplasm, longer root hairs emerged from smaller trichoblasts so that total trichoblast volume (root hair plus cell body) was generally similar regardless of shoot vigour. Similarly, the sizes of the four main cell types on the leaf epidermis became progressively smaller as shoot vigour increased, which also increased stomatal density. The relationship between shoot vigour and root traits is considered, and the potential contribution of below-ground root traits to performance and competitiveness of high vigour germplasm is discussed.},

              Background
              The need for rapid in-field measurement of key traits contributing to yield over many thousands of genotypes is a major roadblock in crop breeding. Recently, leaf hyperspectral reflectance data has been used to train machine learning models using partial least squares regression ({PLSR}) to rapidly predict genetic variation in photosynthetic and leaf traits across wheat populations, among other species. However, the application of published {PLSR} spectral models is limited by a fixed spectral wavelength range as input and the requirement of separate custom-built models for each trait and wavelength range. In addition, the use of reflectance spectra from the short-wave infrared region requires expensive multiple detector spectrometers. The ability to train a model that can accommodate input from different spectral ranges would potentially make such models extensible to more affordable sensors. Here we compare the accuracy of prediction of {PLSR} with various deep learning approaches and an ensemble model, each trained and tested using previously published data sets.
            
            
              Results
              We demonstrate that the accuracy of {PLSR} to predict photosynthetic and related leaf traits in wheat can be improved with deep learning-based and ensemble models without overfitting. Additionally, these models can be flexibly applied across spectral ranges without significantly compromising accuracy.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The method reported provides an improved prediction of wheat leaf and photosynthetic traits from leaf hyperspectral reflectance and do not require a full range, high cost leaf spectrometer. We provide a web service for deploying these algorithms to predict physiological traits in wheat from a variety of spectral data sets, with important implications for wheat yield prediction and crop breeding.},

These structures, named root hairs ({RHs}) in plants and villi in mammals, numerously stretch into the environment, and extremely enlarge root and intestine surfaces. They are believed to forage for nutrients, and mediate their uptake. While the conceptional understanding of plant {RH} function in hydromineral nutrition seems clear, experimental evidence presented in textbooks is restricted to a very limited number of reference-nutrients. Here, we make an element-by-element journey through the periodic table and link individual nutrient availabilities to the development, structure/shape and function of {RHs}. Based on recent developments in molecular biology and the identification of mutants differing in number, length or other shape-related characteristics of {RHs} in various plant species, we present comprehensive advances in (i) the physiological role of {RHs} for the uptake of specific nutrients, (ii) the developmental and morphological responses of {RHs} to element availability and (iii) {RH}-localized nutrient transport proteins. Our update identifies crucial roles of {RHs} for hydromineral nutrition, mostly under nutrient and/or water limiting conditions, and highlights the influence of certain mineral availabilities on early stages of {RH} development, suggesting that nutritional stimuli, as deficiencies in P, Mn or B, can even dominate over intrinsic developmental programs underlying {RH} differentiation.},

              Root hairs are specialized cells that are important for nutrient uptake. It is well established that nutrients such as phosphate have a great influence on root hair development in many plant species. Here we investigated the role of nitrate on root hair development at a physiological and molecular level. We showed that nitrate increases root hair density in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . We found that two different root hair defective mutants have significantly less nitrate than wild‚Äêtype plants, suggesting that in
              A.¬†thaliana
              root hairs have an important role in the capacity to acquire nitrate. Nitrate reductase‚Äênull mutants exhibited nitrate‚Äêdependent root hair phenotypes comparable with wild‚Äêtype plants, indicating that nitrate is the signal that leads to increased formation of root hairs. We examined the role of two key regulators of root hair cell fate,
              
                {CPC}

                {WER}
              
              , in response to nitrate treatments. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants showed that
              
                {CPC}
              
              is essential for nitrate‚Äêinduced responses of root hair development. Moreover, we showed that
              {NRT}

In this study, we investigated the role of nitrate as a signal to control root hair development and identified regulatory factors in nitrate signaling pathway that are involved in this developmental response in

              Lateral roots and root hairs are essential portions of cotton roots. However, the morphology and lifespan of cotton (
              Gossypium hirsutum
              L.) lateral roots and root hairs in response to nitrogen stress have remained unknown. Two cotton cultivars were assessed when no nitrogen and normal nitrogen (138¬†mg¬†N¬∑kg
              ‚àí1
              soil) were added. The daily acquisitions of root phenotype information including the lateral root angle, lateral root density, lateral root diameter, lateral root lifespan, root hair length, root hair density, and root hair lifespan, were obtained in situ by a self‚Äêdesigned platform of {RhizoPots} equipped with high‚Äêresolution scanners. Nitrogen starvation significantly reduced the growth of shoots and roots, although there was less reduction of roots than shoots. Root hairs were the first organ to respond to nitrogen deficiency through morphological changes. The lateral root diameter and angle as well as the root hair lifespan decreased significantly under nitrogen stress. However, nitrogen deficiency dramatically increased the lateral root lifespan, root hair density and length. Our results demonstrate that low nitrogen can induce notable changes in lateral roots and root hairs, which may play a crucial role in the adjustment to nitrogen uptake, particularly in species that can adapt to low nitrogen availability.},

Genetic variation exists for both root hair length and the plasticity of root hair length in response to P availability, where plasticity manifests as increased root hair length in response to low P availability. Although it is known that long root hairs assist P acquisition, the utility of phenotypic plasticity for this trait is not known. To assess the utility of root hair plasticity for adaptation to low phosphorus availability, we evaluated six recombinant inbred lines of maize (Zea mays L.) with varying root hair lengths and root hair plasticity in a controlled environment and in the field. Genotypes with long root hairs under low P availability had significantly greater plant growth, P uptake, specific P absorption rates and lower metabolic cost-benefit ratios than short-haired genotypes. Root hair length had no direct effect on root respiration. In the controlled environment, plastic genotypes had greater biomass allocation to roots, greater reduction in specific root respiration and greater final biomass accumulation at low phosphorus availability than constitutively long-haired genotypes. In the field study, the growth of plastic and long-haired genotypes were comparable under low P, but both were superior to short-haired genotypes. We propose that root hair plasticity is a component of a broader suite of traits, including plasticity in root respiration, that permit greater root growth and phosphorus acquisition in low P soils.},

            To meet the demands of a rising human population, plant breeders will need to develop improved crop varieties that maximize yield in the face of increasing pressure on crop production. Historically, the optimization of crop root architecture has represented a challenging breeding target due to the inaccessibility of the root systems. Root hairs, single cell projections from the root epidermis, are perhaps the most overlooked component of root architecture traits. Root hairs play a central role in facilitating water, nutrient uptake, and soil cohesion. Current root hair architectures may be suboptimal under future agricultural production regimes, coupled with an increasingly variable climate. Here, we review the genetic control of root hair development in the world‚Äôs three most important crops‚Äîrice, maize, and wheat‚Äîand highlight conservation of gene function between monocots and the model dicot species Arabidopsis. Advances in genomic techniques including gene editing combined with traditional plant breeding methods have the potential to overcome many inherent issues associated with the design of improved root hair architectures. Ultimately, this will enable detailed characterization of the effects of contrasting root hair morphology strategies on crop yield and resilience, and the development of new varieties better adapted to deliver future food security.},

            Sufficient water is essential for plant growth and production. Root hairs connect roots to the soil, extend the effective root radius, and greatly enlarge the absorbing surface area. Although the efficacy of root hairs in nutrient uptake, especially phosphorus, has been well recognized, their role in water uptake remains contentious. Here we review recent advances in this field, discuss the factors affecting the role of root hairs in water uptake, and propose future directions. We argue that root hair length and shrinkage, in response to soil drying, explain the apparently contradictory evidence currently available. Our analysis revealed that shorter and vulnerable root hairs (i.e. rice and maize) made little, if any, contribution to root water uptake. In contrast, relatively longer root hairs (i.e. barley) had a clear influence on root water uptake, transpiration, and hence plant response to soil drying. We conclude that the role of root hairs in water uptake is species (and probably soil) specific. We propose that a holistic understanding of the efficacy of root hairs in water uptake will require detailed studies of root hair length, turnover, and shrinkage in different species and contrasting soil textures.},

              Background and Aims
              Previous laboratory studies have suggested selection for root hair traits in future crop breeding to improve resource use efficiency and stress tolerance. However, data on the interplay between root hairs and open-field systems, under contrasting soils and climate conditions, are limited. As such, this study aims to experimentally elucidate some of the impacts that root hairs have on plant performance on a field scale.
            
            
              Methods
              A field experiment was set up in Scotland for two consecutive years, under contrasting climate conditions and different soil textures (i.e. clay loam vs. sandy loam). Five barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes exhibiting variation in root hair length and density were used in the study. Root hair length, density and rhizosheath weight were measured at several growth stages, as well as shoot biomass, plant water status, shoot phosphorus (P) accumulation and grain yield.
            
            
              Key Results
              Measurements of root hair density, length and its correlation with rhizosheath weight highlighted trait robustness in the field under variable environmental conditions, although significant variations were found between soil textures as the growing season progressed. Root hairs did not confer a notable advantage to barley under optimal conditions, but under soil water deficit root hairs enhanced plant water status and stress tolerance resulting in a less negative leaf water potential and lower leaf abscisic acid concentration, while promoting shoot P accumulation. Furthermore, the presence of root hairs did not decrease yield under optimal conditions, while root hairs enhanced yield stability under drought.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Selecting for beneficial root hair traits can enhance yield stability without diminishing yield potential, overcoming the breeder‚Äôs dilemma of trying to simultaneously enhance both productivity and resilience. Therefore, the maintenance or enhancement of root hairs can represent a key trait for breeding the next generation of crops for improved drought tolerance in relation to climate change.},

            Although the role of root hairs ({RHs}) in nutrient uptake is well documented, their role in water uptake and drought tolerance remains controversial. Maize (Zea mays) wild-type and its hair-defective mutant (Mut; roothairless 3) were grown in two contrasting soil textures (sand and loam). We used a root pressure chamber to measure the relation between transpiration rate (E) and leaf xylem water potential (œàleaf\_x) during soil drying. Our hypotheses were: (1) {RHs} extend root‚Äìsoil contact and reduce the œàleaf\_x decline at high E in dry soils; (2) the impact of {RHs} is more pronounced in sand; and (3) Muts partly compensate for lacking {RHs} by producing longer and/or thicker roots. The œàleaf\_x(E) relation was linear in wet conditions and became nonlinear as the soils dried. This nonlinearity occurred more abruptly and at less negative matric potentials in sand (ca. ‚àí10‚Äâ{kPa}) than in loam (ca. ‚àí100‚Äâ{kPa}). At more negative soil matric potentials, soil hydraulic conductance became smaller than root hydraulic conductance in both soils. Both genotypes exhibited 1.7 times longer roots in loam, but 1.6 times thicker roots in sand. No differences were observed in the œàleaf\_x(E) relation and active root length between the two genotypes. In maize, {RHs} had a minor contribution to soil‚Äìplant hydraulics in both soils and their putative role in water uptake was smaller than that reported for barley (Hordeum vulgare). These results suggest that the role of {RHs} cannot be easily generalized across species and soil textures affect the response of root hydraulics to soil drying.},

	abstract = {The rapid and non-destructive monitoring of the canopy leaf nitrogen concentration ({LNC}) in crops is important for precise nitrogen (N) management. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to identify next-generation bio-physical variable retrieval algorithms that can be incorporated into an operational processing chain for hyperspectral satellite missions. We assessed six retrieval algorithms for estimating {LNC} from canopy reflectance of winter wheat in eight field experiments. These experiments represented variations in the N application rates, planting densities, ecological sites and cultivars and yielded a total of 821 samples from various places in Jiangsu, China over nine consecutive years. Based on the reflectance spectra and their first derivatives, six methods using different numbers of wavelengths were applied to construct predictive models for estimating wheat {LNC}, including continuum removal ({CR}), vegetation indices ({VIs}), stepwise multiple linear regression ({SMLR}), partial least squares regression ({PLSR}), artificial neural networks ({ANNs}), and support vector machines ({SVMs}). To assess the performance of these six methods, we provided a systematic evaluation of the estimation accuracies using the six metrics that were the coefficients of determination for the calibration (R2C) and validation (R2V) sets, the root mean square errors of prediction ({RMSEP}) for the calibration and validation sets, the ratio of prediction to deviation ({RPD}), the computational efficiency ({CE}) and the complexity level ({CL}). The following results were obtained: (1) For the {VIs} method, {SAVI}(R1200, R705) produced a more accurate estimation of the {LNC} than other indices, with R¬≤C, R¬≤V, {RMSEP}, {RPD} and {CE} values of 0.844, 0.795, 0.384, 2.005 and 0.10 min, respectively; (2) For the {SMLR}, {PLSR}, {ANNs} and {SVMs} methods, the {SVMs} using the first derivative canopy spectra ({SVM}-{FDS}) offered the best accuracy in terms of R¬≤C, R¬≤V, {RMSEP}, {RPD}, and {CE}, at 0.96, 0.78, 0.37, 2.02, and 21.17, respectively; (3) The {PLSR}-{FDS}, {ANN}-{OS} and {SVM}-{FDS} methods yield similar accuracies if the {CE} and {CL} are not considered, however, {ANNs} and {SVMs} performed better on calibration set than the validation set which indicate that we should take more caution with the two methods for over-fitting. Except {PLS} method, the performance for most methods did not enhance when the spectrum were operated by the first derivative. Moreover, the evaluation of the robustness demonstrates that {SVM} method may be better suited than the other methods to cope with potential confounding factors for most varieties, ecological site and growth stage; (4) The prediction accuracy was found to be higher when more wavelengths were used, though at the cost of a lower {CE}. The findings are of interest to the remote sensing community for the development of improved inversion schemes for hyperspectral applications concerning other types of vegetation. The examples provided in this paper may also serve to illustrate the advantages and shortcomings of empirical hyperspectral models for mapping important vegetation biophysical properties of other crops.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods of plant nutrient estimation for nutrient management need a huge number of leaf or tissue samples and extensive chemical analysis, which is time-consuming and expensive. Remote sensing is a viable tool to estimate the plant‚Äôs nutritional status to determine the appropriate amounts of fertilizer inputs. The aim of the study was to use remote sensing to characterize the foliar nutrient status of mango through the development of spectral indices, multivariate analysis, chemometrics, and machine learning modeling of the spectral data. A spectral database within the 350‚Äì1050 nm wavelength range of the leaf samples and leaf nutrients were analyzed for the development of spectral indices and multivariate model development. The normalized difference and ratio spectral indices and multivariate models‚Äìpartial least square regression ({PLSR}), principal component regression, and support vector regression ({SVR}) were ineffective in predicting any of the leaf nutrients. An approach of using {PLSR}-combined machine learning models was found to be the best to predict most of the nutrients. Based on the independent validation performance and summed ranks, the best performing models were cubist (R2 ‚â• 0.91, the ratio of performance to deviation ({RPD}) ‚â• 3.3, and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance ({RPIQ}) ‚â• 3.71) for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc, {SVR} (R2 ‚â• 0.88, {RPD} ‚â• 2.73, {RPIQ} ‚â• 3.31) for calcium, iron, copper, boron, and elastic net (R2 ‚â• 0.95, {RPD} ‚â• 4.47, {RPIQ} ‚â• 6.11) for magnesium and sulfur. The results of the study revealed the potential of using hyperspectral remote sensing data for non-destructive estimation of mango leaf macro- and micro-nutrients. The developed approach is suggested to be employed within operational retrieval workflows for precision management of mango orchard nutrients.},
